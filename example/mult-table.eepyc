Here is a multiplication table:

{{%
    # This is the inside of a statement tag, specified with '%'.

    # Define a variable.
    size = 9

    # Use list comprehensions to create a multiplication table.
    table = [[(i + 1) * (j + 1) for i in range(size)] for j in range(size)]

    # Print the multiplication table. When evaluated, this statement tag
    # will be replaced by the output of the print() calls in the tag.
    for row in table:
        print(''.join([f"{v:3}" for v in row]))
}}
